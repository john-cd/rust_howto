# # If necessary, you can exclude one or more links from being checked with a

# # the `./index.html` in `[some page](./index.html)`) so it can be used to
# # ignore both web and filesystem links.

# # How should warnings be treated?

# # - "warn" will emit warning messages
# # - "error" treats all warnings as errors, failing the linkcheck
# # - "ignore" will ignore warnings, suppressing diagnostic messages and allowing
# #   the linkcheck to continuing

# # in order to link check to succeed.

# # This is a dictionary (map), with keys being regexes
# # matching a set of web sites, and values being an array of
# # the headers.

# #'crates\.io' = ["Accept: text/html"]

# # mdbook-linkcheck will interpolate environment variables into your header via
# # $IDENT.
# #
# # If this is not what you want you must escape the `$` symbol, like `\$TOKEN`.
# # `\` itself can also be escaped via `\\`.
# #
# # Note: If interpolation fails, the header will be skipped and the failure will
# # be logged. This can be useful if a particular header isn't always necessary,
# # but may be helpful (e.g. when working with rate limiting).
