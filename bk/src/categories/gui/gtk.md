`gtk4` offers Rust bindings of the GTK 4 library. These are quite well supported, although you'll often need to use the C documentation.

[`relm4`][c-relm4]â®³{{hi:relm4}} is a higher-level library that sits on top of `gtk4-rs`. An idiomatic GUI library inspired by `Elm`.

[gtk: write (P2)](https://github.com/john-cd/rust_howto/issues/383)

For GTK development in Rust, the `gtk` crate is absolutely essential. You'll use it to create widgets, handle events, manage layouts, and interact with the GTK library. The `gdk`, `gio`, and `glib` crates are used indirectly through `gtk`. Understanding GTK concepts and consulting the official GTK documentation are crucial for effective development.

## Key Concepts

- Widgets: The basic building blocks of a GTK application (buttons, labels, windows, etc.).
- Signals: How GTK widgets communicate with each other and your application code (e.g., button clicks).
- Layouts: How widgets are arranged within windows.
- Events: User input (mouse clicks, keyboard presses, etc.).
- GTK Main Loop: The event loop that processes GTK events.

## GTK Bindings

`gtk` is the primary crate for using GTK in Rust. It provides safe and idiomatic bindings to the GTK library. It's the-most important* crate for GTK development in Rust.

## Related GTK Crates

- `gdk`: Provides bindings to the GDK (Graphics Device Kit) library, which is used by GTK for low-level graphics and windowing. You'll often use this indirectly through `gtk`.
- `gio`: Bindings to the GIO (GNOME Input/Output) library, used for asynchronous operations, file I/O, and other system-related tasks in GTK applications.
- `glib`: Provides bindings to the GLib library, which is the foundation for GTK and GIO. You'll often use this indirectly.

### Build Tools

- `cargo`: The standard Rust build tool.
- pkg-config: Often used to find and link against the GTK libraries during the build process.

### GTK Version Compatibility

Make sure the `gtk` crate version you're using is compatible with the GTK version installed on your system.

### Documentation

The official GTK documentation is essential. While the `gtk` crate provides Rust bindings, understanding the underlying GTK concepts is crucial.
