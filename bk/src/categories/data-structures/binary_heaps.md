## Work with a Binary Heap {#binary-heap}

[![std][c~std~docs~badge]][c~std~docs] [![cat~data-structures][cat~data-structures~badge]][cat~data-structures]

`std::collections::BinaryHeap` is a binary heap, where elements can be efficiently inserted and the maximum or minimum element can be quickly accessed. By default, `BinaryHeap` is a "max-heap", meaning the largest element is always at the top. The following demonstrates its basic operations:

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../../crates/cats/data_structures/examples/binaryheap/binaryheap.rs:example}}
```

## Create a Priority Queue {#priority-queue}

A priority queue is a type of data structure where each element is assigned a priority, and elements with higher priority are processed before those with lower priority. Common use cases include:

- Managing tasks where the highest-priority task must always be processed next.
- Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.
- Handling events in chronological order.
- Efficiently finding the K largest items in a stream of data without sorting the entire set.

The [`priority-queue`][c~priority-queue~docs]â†—{{hi:priority-queue}} crate provides a more versatile priority queue than `std::collections::BinaryHeap`, most notably allowing you to assign separate priorities to items.

This example demonstrates the usage of the `priority-queue` crate in Rust. It showcases various functionalities including creating a priority queue,
inserting elements, popping elements, using custom types, and more:

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../../crates/cats/data_structures/examples/binaryheap/priority_queue.rs:example}}
