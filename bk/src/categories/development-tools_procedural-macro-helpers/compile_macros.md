[`watt`][c-watt]â®³{{hi:watt}} is a runtime for executing Rust procedural [macros][p-macros] compiled as WebAssembly (WASM). By compiling [macros][p-macros] ahead-of-time to WASM, we save all downstream users of the macro from having to compile the macro logic or its dependencies themselves. Instead, what they compile is a small self-contained WASM runtime (~3 seconds, shared by all macros) and a tiny proc macro shim for each macro crate to hand off WASM bytecode into the Watt runtime (~0.3 seconds per proc-macro crate you depend on). This is much less than the 20+ seconds it can take to compile complex procedural [macros][p-macros] and their dependencies.
