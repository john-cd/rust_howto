# Date and Time

[![cat-date-and-time][cat-date-and-time-badge]][cat-date-and-time]{{hi:Date and time}}

Manage the complexity of dealing with the fourth dimension.

There are two key libraries:

- [`chrono`][c-chrono]⮳{{hi:chrono}}: a comprehensive, full-featured, yet complex date and time library,
- `time`: a smaller, simpler library with limited functionality.

There is no clear answer as to which is best between `time` and [`chrono`][c-chrono]⮳{{hi:chrono}}. Evaluate for yourself between these two, but both are trusted and well-maintained.

## Parsing and displaying
