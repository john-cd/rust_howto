## Financial Calculations

`financial`: Provides a range of financial calculations (present value, future value, interest rates, etc.). A good starting point.
`rust-finance`: Another crate with financial functions.

## Working with Currencies

`iso4217`: Provides ISO 4217 currency codes.
`rust-money`: For working with monetary values and currencies.

## Date and Time (Essential for Finance)

`chrono`: A widely used crate for date and time calculations.
`time`: A newer crate, often preferred.

## Data Analysis and Statistics

`statrs`: A comprehensive statistics library.
`nalgebra`: Linear algebra crate, often used in financial modeling.
`ndarray`: N-dimensional arrays, useful for handling financial data.

## Data Access (Often Needed)

Many options depending on your data source. Examples:
`reqwest`: For making HTTP requests to financial APIs.
`csv`: For reading and writing CSV files (common for financial data).
`serde`: For serializing and deserializing financial data (JSON, etc.).

## Charting and Visualization

`plotters`: A plotting library for creating charts and graphs of financial data.

## Trading and Market Data

Often requires specific API wrappers or libraries for the exchanges or data providers you're using. There isn't a single "trading crate.")

## Risk Management

Often involves custom calculations and models. The statistics and linear algebra crates above can be helpful.

## Accounting

There aren't widely used, general-purpose accounting crates in Rust yet. This area is often handled with custom solutions.

## Key Concepts

- Time value of money: Present value, future value, etc.
- Interest rates: Simple, compound, APR, APY.
- Financial instruments: Stocks, bonds, options, etc.
- Risk management: Volatility, diversification, etc.
- Financial modeling: Building models to analyze financial data.

The `financial` crate is a good starting point for basic financial calculations. For more advanced analysis, you'll likely need the statistics and linear algebra crates.  Date/time handling is essential. Data access depends on your data source.  Trading and accounting often require custom solutions or very specific API integrations.
