Flight Dynamics: Simulating the motion of aircraft or spacecraft, including forces (lift, drag, thrust, gravity), equations of motion, and aerodynamic models.

Orbital Mechanics: Simulating the motion of satellites or other objects in orbit, including orbital parameters, Kepler's laws, and perturbation effects.

Control Systems: Simulating the behavior of control systems, such as PID controllers, attitude control systems, and guidance algorithms.

Environment Modeling: Creating models of the environment, including terrain, atmosphere, and other objects (e.g., other aircraft, obstacles).

Sensor Simulation: Simulating the behavior of sensors, such as IMUs, GPS receivers, and cameras.

Multi-body Dynamics: Simulating the interaction of multiple bodies, which is important fo

Rust Crates and Approaches:

Physics Engines:

 (Limited mature physics engines in pure Rust): This is a challenging area. Many robust physics engines are written in C/C++.
  `rapier`: A 2D and 3D physics engine written in Rust. It might be suitable for some aerospace simulations, especially if you don't need highly specialized aerospace physics.
  `bevy_rapier`: Integration between rapier and the bevy game engine.

FFI (Foreign Function Interface): For more advanced aerospace simulations, you'll likely need to use FFI to interact with existing C/C++ physics engines like:
  `Bullet`: A popular open-source physics engine.
  `ODE` (Open Dynamics Engine): Another open-source option.
  `Simbody`: A high-performance library for multibody dynamics (often used in robotics and aerospace).

Linear Algebra:

 `nalgebra`: Excellent for vector, matrix, and quaternion operations, which are fundamental to aerospace simulations.
 `ndarray`: Another good option for numerical array operations.

Link to Visualization:

  `bevy`: A data-driven game engine that might be suitable for 3D visualization of aerospace simulations.
  `plotters`: For creating plots and charts of simulation data.
