## This Book Includes Most of the "Rust Cookbook"

The "Rust How-to" project started as a set of notes kept while the author was learning Rust and evolved into a book. While writing it, the author realized that the [Rust Cookbook][book~rust-cookbook]↗ community project and this book share very similar goals.

While the "Rust Cookbook" is "official" (hosted in a Rust Foundation-linked GitHub organization), few updates have been made in the last 4 years and unfortunately many of its examples no longer work. The author therefore decided to refresh these examples and merge them into this book.

Thanks to the many [contributors][rust-cookbook-contributors~repo]↗ of the "Rust Cookbook".
