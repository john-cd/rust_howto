# Rust Language

This section is designed to provide a quick reference for Rust's language features, syntax, and best practices.

It is not intended to be a beginner's book nor a comprehensive guide, but rather a tool for those who are looking to refresh their knowledge. The [`Rust book`][book~rust]{{hi:Rust book}}â®³ is an excellent resource for complete beginners to get started with. Refer as well to the [[books | books]] chapter for a list of relevant books.
