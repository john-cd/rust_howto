# Rust language

Rust is a modern programming language that offers high performance, reliability, and productivity. It is designed to prevent common errors such as memory leaks{{hi:Memory leaks}}, data races{{hi:Data races}}, and null pointer dereferences{{hi:Null pointer dereferences}}, by enforcing strict rules at compile time. Rust also supports powerful features such as generics{{hi:Generics}}, traits{{hi:Traits}}, macros{{hi:Macros}}, and concurrency{{hi:Concurrency}}, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Rust prefers snake case for variables and functions, so a method would be called `read_str` instead of `readStr`. For structs, traits and enums, camel case (or Pascal case) is used, for example `HttpClient`.
