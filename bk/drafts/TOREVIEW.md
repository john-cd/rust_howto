### Graceful Upgrades {#skip}

[bye~github]: https://github.com/dgagn/bye A system for graceful upgrades: it's a fork+exec mechanism with a Linux pipe for passing data between the original process and the "upgraded" process. It's designed to work well with `systemd` for zero-downtime upgrades. In production I use it alongside systemd's socket activation, but it should be tweakable to work with alternatives. It mostly follows systemd conventions so you can drop it into a typical service setup without too much fuss.
If you're doing long-lived services in Rust and want painless, no-downtime upgrades, I'd love for you to give it a try (or tear it apart, your choice
