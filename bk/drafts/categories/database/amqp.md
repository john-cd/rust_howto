# Message Queues (AMQP)

{{#include amqp.incl.md}}

`AMQP` stands for `Advanced Message Queuing Protocol`. It is an open standard messaging protocol that is used to reliably exchange messages between applications or systems, even if they are written in different [programming languages][p-programming-languages] and running on different platforms. `AMQP` ensures that messages are delivered reliably, even if there are network issues or system failures. It offers different levels of delivery guarantees, from "at-most-once" to "exactly-once" delivery.

`RabbitMQ` is an example of a popular message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It use cases include microservices communication,
task queues, background job processing, and publish-subscribe (pub-sub).
