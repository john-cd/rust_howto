Here are some notable games built with Rust:

|||
|---|---|---|
| `Veloren` | It's a multiplayer, open-world voxel RPG with a beautiful aesthetic. Think `Minecraft` meets `Breath of the Wild`, with a dash of `Dwarf Fortress`. It's open-source and has a dedicated community. |
| `Zemeroth` | A turn-based tactical game with a unique, tabletop-inspired design. It's also open-source and has a charming, nostalgic feel. |
| `Nox Futura` | This one's still in development, but it's got a lot of potential. It's a 3D colony-building game with survival elements, reminiscent of `Dwarf Fortress`. |
| `Epicinium` | A strategy game with simultaneous turns and a focus on resource management. It has a cool map editor, too. |
| `Hypercoven` | A real-time strategy game with a unique art style. |

There's a growing collection of smaller indie games made with Rust on `itch.io`. You can find everything from puzzle games to platformers to simulations there. Check out the ["made with Rust"](https://itch.io/games/made-with-rust) tag!
