# Software Architecture: Steps

## Define Objectives and Requirements

- Identify the purpose of the project (e.g., web service, embedded system, CLI tool, etc.).
  - Web Applications: Frameworks like Actix-web, Rocket, or Axum.
  - CLI Tools: Building command-line utilities with `clap` or `structopt`.
  - Embedded Systems: Leveraging Rust's low-level control for IoT devices.

- List functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, scalability, maintainability).
- Determine the necessary Rust libraries (use this book!) and external integrations.

### Design System Components

- Core Modules: Define the core business logic of the system. Use [[traits | Traits]] for abstraction and flexibility.
- Data Models: Design type-safe models using Rust's `struct`s and `enum`s.
- Concurrency and Asynchrony: Leverage tools like `tokio` or `async-std` for asynchronous tasks.

### Choose a Project Structure

- Use Rust's module system for organization.
- A common structure is as follows:

```txt
src/
├── main.rs       (entry point)
├── lib.rs        (library code)
├── config/       (configuration files and parsing)
├── services/     (business logic)
├── models/       (data models)
├── api/          (REST or other interfaces)
├── utils/        (utility functions and helpers)

tests/            (integration tests)
```

### Choose Key Technologies

Use this book!

- Configuration: Use `config` or `dotenvy` for loading environment variables.
- Web Framework (if applicable): use Actix-web, Axum, or Rocket for web services.
- Database: Use `sqlx` or `diesel` for interacting with databases.
- Logging: Use `log` or `tracing` for structured logging.

### Modularize

- Use Rust's [[modules | Modules]] to structure your code.
- Use crates like `shaku` for dependency injection, promoting modularity and testability.

### Handle Error Management

- Use Rust's `Result` and `Option` types to handle errors gracefully.
- Create custom error types using `thiserror` and use `anyhow` for descriptive error messages.

See:

- [[error_handling | Error Handling]].
- [[error_customization | Error Customization]].

### Ensure Test Coverage

- Write unit tests using `#[test]` in individual modules.
- Include integration tests for component interaction.
- Use mocking libraries like `mockall` to test without relying on real external systems.

See [[testing | Testing]].

### Optimize Performance

- Profile and benchmark using `criterion` or other profiling tools.
- Minimize memory allocation and leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions.
- Memory Management: Minimizing allocations and leveraging stack memory.
- Profiling Tools: Using `perf` or `valgrind` for performance analysis.
- Parallelism: Utilizing `rayon` for data parallelism.
- Concurrency: Fearless concurrency using threads, async/await, and message passing.

See [[performance | Performance]] and [[development-tools_profiling | Profiling]].

## Ensure Security

- Safe [[concurrency | Concurrency]]: Avoiding data races with Rust's ownership model.
- [[cryptography | Cryptography]]: Using crates like `ring` or the `rust-crypto` suite.
- [[authentication | Authentication]].

## Deployment and Operations

- [[building | Build]]  the project using `cargo build`.
- Containerize with Docker or deploy to a platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other tools.
- Observability: Monitor with tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
