Here are some notable games built with Rust:

|||
|---|---|---|
| [`Veloren`][veloren.net~website]↗{{hi:Veloren}} | It's a multiplayer, open-world voxel RPG with a beautiful aesthetic. Think [`Minecraft`][minecraft~website]↗{{hi:Minecraft}} meets `Breath of the Wild`, with a dash of `Dwarf Fortress`. It's open-source and has a dedicated community. |
| [`Zemeroth`][zemeroth~website]↗{{hi:Zemeroth}} | A turn-based tactical game with a unique, tabletop-inspired design. It's also open-source and has a charming, nostalgic feel. |
| [`Nox Futura`][nox-futura~website]↗{{hi:Nox Futura}} | This one's still in development, but it's got a lot of potential. It's a 3D colony-building game with survival elements, reminiscent of `Dwarf Fortress`. |
| [`Epicinium`][epicinium~website]↗{{hi:Epicinium}} | A strategy game with simultaneous turns and a focus on resource management. It has a cool map editor, too. |
| [`Hypercoven`][hypercoven~website]↗{{hi:Hypercoven}} | A real-time strategy game with a unique art style. |

There's a growing collection of smaller indie games made with Rust on [`itch.io`][itch.io~website]↗{{hi:itch.io}}. You can find everything from puzzle games to platformers to simulations there. Check out the ["made with Rust"][itch.io~made-with-rust~website]↗ tag!
