# Localization

[![cat~localization][cat~localization~badge]][cat~localization]{{hi:Localization}}

Tooling to help adapting internationalized software to specific languages and regions.

Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale).

We decided to cover localization as a part of the closely related [[internationalization | Internationalization]] topic.

## Code Examples
