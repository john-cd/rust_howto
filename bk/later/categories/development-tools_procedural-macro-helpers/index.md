# Development Tools: Procedural Macro Helpers

[![cat~development-tools::procedural-macro-helpers][cat~development-tools::procedural-macro-helpers~badge]][cat~development-tools::procedural-macro-helpers]{{hi:Procedural macro helpers}}

The term 'macro' [(book)][book~rust~macros]â†— refers to a family of features in Rust: declarative macros (also known as "macros by example") and three kinds of _procedural macros_, the focus of this section:

- Custom #[derive] macros, used on structs and enums, which specify code to be added.
- Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item.
- Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens specified as their argument.
