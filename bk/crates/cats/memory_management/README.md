## NOTES

A few tests use attributes that must be applied at the crate level.
As such, they must be placed at the root of the `tests` folder.

Code examples are found under `examples/<chapter_name>`, where `<chapter_name>` is the name of the `.md` file in `bk/<...>/categories/<category_name>` that includes these examples.
