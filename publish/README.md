# Rust How-To

**A documentation summary and a compendium of snippets and recipes for the Rust language and ecosystem.**
**Everything you need for day-to-day Rust coding, all in one place.**

The "Rust How-To" book is deployed on [john-cd.com/rust_howto][rust-howto]

GitHub repo: [github.com/john-cd/rust_howto][rust-howto-github]

## Note

This is a placeholder crate. You can `cargo install rust_howto`, but the executable does not do much apart from printing key values from the manifest :-)
