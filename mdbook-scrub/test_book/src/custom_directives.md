# Custom Directives

The `rust_howto` book uses custom directives to insert examples, crate badges, etc.

The following should be scrubbed if the corresponding configuration toggles are set (which they are by default).

## Example directive

{{#example}}

{{#example }}

{{#example some_example}}

{{#example some_example }}

## Crate directive

{{#crate}}

{{#crate }}

{{#crate some_crate}}

{{#crate some_crate }}
