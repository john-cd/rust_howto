## Advanced caching, if needed:

## - https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-home.html?highlight=crate%20cache#caching-the-cargo-home-in-ci
## Add to steps:
      ## Use the following step in conjunction with cache_from/to type=local in `compose-ci.yaml`
      # - name: Set up cargo cache
      #   uses: actions/cache@v3
      #   continue-on-error: false
      #   with:
      #     path: |
      #       ./.cache/
      #     key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
      #     restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-
      ## Adjust the path and key
