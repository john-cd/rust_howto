# Cross-compilation

## Cross

[![cross-github][cross-github-badge]][cross-github]

[cross][cross-github]â®³ builds your Rust project for different target operating systems and architectures.
It requires `rustup` and `Docker` or `Podman`.

```sh
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross

# Optionally, if you have cargo-binstall, you can install via pre-built binary
cargo binstall cross
```

`cross` has the exact same CLI as Cargo but relies on Docker or Podman.

```sh
cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

cross test --target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64

cross run --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
