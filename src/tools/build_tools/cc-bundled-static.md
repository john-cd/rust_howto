## Compile and link statically to a bundled C library

[![cc-badge]][cc] [![cat-development-tools-badge]][cat-development-tools]

To accommodate scenarios where additional C, C++, or assembly is required in a project, the [**cc**][cc] crate
offers a simple api for compiling bundled C/C++/asm code into static libraries (**.a**) that can be statically linked to by **rustc**.

The following example has some bundled C code (**src/hello.c**) that will be used from rust.
Before compiling rust source code, the "build" file (**build.rs**) specified in **Cargo.toml** runs.
Using the [**cc**][cc] crate, a static library file will be produced (in this case, **libhello.a**, see
[`compile` docs][cc-build-compile]) which can then be used from rust by declaring the external function signatures in an `extern` block.

Since the bundled C is very simple, only a single source file needs to be passed to [`cc::Build`][cc-build].
For more complex build requirements, [`cc::Build`][cc-build] offers a full suite of builder methods for specifying
[`include`][cc-build-include] paths and extra compiler [`flag`][cc-build-flag]s.

### `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"

[build-dependencies]
cc = "1"

[dependencies]
error-chain = "0.11"
```

### `build.rs`

```rust,editable,no_run
{#include ../../../deps/examples/cc-bundled-static.rs}
```

### `src/hello.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>


void hello() {
    printf("Hello from C!\n");
}

void greet(const char* name) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}
```

### `src/main.rs`

```rust,editable,ignore
{#include ../../../deps/examples/cc-bundled-static2.rs}
```
