# Structs

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/examples/structs.rs}}
```

Struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/examples/structs2.rs}}
```

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/examples/structs3.rs}}
```

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/examples/structs4.rs}}
```

{{#include ../link-refs.md}}
