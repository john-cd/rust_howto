# Structs

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/tests/structs.rs}}
```

Struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/tests/structs2.rs}}
```

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/tests/structs3.rs}}
```

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../deps/tests/structs4.rs}}
```

{{#include ../refs/link-refs.md}}
