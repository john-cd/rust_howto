# Simple Data Types

- Integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`
- Unsigned: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u128`, `usize`
  - `usize` and `isize` are 32 or 64 bits, depending on the architecture of the computer.
- Floating point: `f32`, `f64`
- Boolean: `bool`: `true`, `false`
- Char: `let z: char = 'ℤ';` Unicode
- Tuples: `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
  - Access via `let five_hundred = x.0;`
  - Destructuring via `let (x, y, z) = tup;`
- Arrays: `let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];` allocated on the stack. access via `let first = a[0];`
  - A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size
- Unit (aka void): `()`
- Type aliases: `type Kilometers = i32;`

## Overflow handling

- Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
- Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
- Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
- Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.
