# Rust language

Rust is a modern programming language that offers high performance, reliability, and productivity. It is designed to prevent common errors such as {{i:memory leaks}}, {{i:data races}}, and {{i:null pointer dereferences}}, by enforcing strict rules at compile time. Rust also supports powerful features such as {{i:generics}}, {{i:traits}}, {{i:macros}}, and {{i:concurrency}}, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Rust prefers snake case for variables and functions, so a method would be called `read_str` instead of `readStr`. For structs, traits and enums, camel case (or Pascal case) is used, for example `HttpClient`.
