# Rust language

Rust is a modern programming language that offers high performance, reliability, and productivity. It is designed to prevent common errors such as memory leaks, data races, and null pointer dereferences, by enforcing strict rules at compile time. Rust also supports powerful features such as generics, traits, macros, and concurrency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Rust prefers snake case for variables and functions, so a method would be called `read_str` instead of `readStr`. For structs, traits and enums, camel case (or Pascal case) is used, for example `HttpClient`.
