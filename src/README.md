**A compendium of examples and recipes for the Rust language and ecosystem.**

**Everything you need for day-to-day Rust coding, all in one place.**

## Prerequisites

Readers should already be familiar with [Rust]( https://www.rust-lang.org/ ). The [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an excellent resource to get started with.

## What you will find here

This book summarizes the basics of the language, such as syntax, data types, control flow, and error handling, as well as more advanced topics, such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, iterators, collections, concurrency, and testing.

You will also learn how to use popular tools and libraries in the Rust ecosystem, such as Cargo, Clippy, Rustfmt, and Rayon.

## Call for contributions

This work is in its early days. Feel free to submit an issue or a pull request to the [repo]( https://github.com/john-cd/rust_howto ).
