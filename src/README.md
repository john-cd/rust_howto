# Rust How-To

**A compendium of examples and recipes for the Rust language and ecosystem.**

**Everything you need for day-to-day Rust coding, all in one place.**

## Prerequisites

Readers should already be familiar with [Rust]( https://www.rust-lang.org/ ). The [Rust book ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an excellent resource to get started with.

## What you will find here

Rust is a modern programming language that offers high performance, reliability, and productivity. It is designed to prevent common errors such as memory leaks, data races, and null pointer dereferences, by enforcing strict rules at compile time. Rust also supports powerful features such as generics, traits, macros, and concurrency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

This book is a practical guide to learning Rust programming. It covers the basics of the language, such as syntax, data types, control flow, and error handling, as well as more advanced topics, such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, iterators, collections, concurrency, and testing. You will also learn how to use popular tools and libraries in the Rust ecosystem, such as Cargo, Clippy, Rustfmt, and Rayon.
