## Obtain backtrace of complex error scenarios

[![error-chain-badge]][error-chain] [![cat-rust-patterns-badge]][cat-rust-patterns]

This recipe shows how to handle a complex error scenario and then
print a backtrace. It relies on [`chain_err`] to extend errors by
appending new errors. The error stack can be unwound, thus providing
a better context to understand why an error was raised.

The below recipes attempts to deserialize the value `256` into a
`u8`. An error will bubble up from Serde then csv and finally up to the
user code.

```rust,editable
{#include ../../../deps/examples/backtrace.rs}
```

Backtrace error rendered:

```text
Error level - description
└> 0 - Cannot read CSV data
└> 1 - Cannot deserialize RGB color
└> 2 - CSV deserialize error: record 1 (line: 2, byte: 15): field 1: number too large to fit in target type
└> 3 - field 1: number too large to fit in target type
```

Run the recipe with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` to display a detailed [`backtrace`] associated with this error.
