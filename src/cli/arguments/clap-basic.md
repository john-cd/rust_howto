## Parse command line arguments

[![clap-badge]][clap]

This application describes the structure of its command-line interface using
`clap`'s builder style. The [documentation] gives two other possible ways to
instantiate an application.

In the builder style, `with_name` is the unique identifier that `value_of` will
use to retrieve the value passed. The `short` and `long` options control the
flag the user will be expected to type; short flags look like `-f` and long
flags look like `--file`.

```rust,editable
{#include ../../../deps/examples/clap-basic.rs}
```

Usage information is generated by `clap`. The usage for the example application
looks like this.

```bash
My Test Program 0.1.0
Hackerman Jones <hckrmnjones@hack.gov>
Teaches argument parsing

USAGE:
    testing [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file <file>     A cool file
    -n, --number <num>    Five less than your favorite number
```

We can test the application by running a command like the following.

```bash
cargo run -- -f myfile.txt -n 251
```

The output is:

```bash
The file passed is: myfile.txt
Your favorite number must be 256.
```
