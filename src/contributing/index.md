# Call for contributions

This book is in its **early days**. Contributions, from small edits to whole chapters, are most welcome.

It is also intended to be easy for (new) Rust programmers to contribute to and get involved with the Rust community.

Feel free to submit an issue or a pull request to the [repo][rust-howto-github]. Draft pages are kept in [this folder][rust-howto-drafts]. An informal (and very long) list of subjects we would like to cover is kept in the [topics of interest](topics_of_interest.md) page.

Embedded examples should be ideally _runnable_ on the [Rust playground][rust-playground]⮳ or at least directly copy-pasteable into Rust code.

This book's long-term goal is the coverage of the 'most commonly used' Rust crates, as defined by [`blessed.rs`][blessed-rs]⮳, the most downloaded libraries in [`crates.io`][crates-io]⮳, and 'high quality crates' per [`lib.rs`][lib-rs]⮳ [statistics][lib-rs-stats]⮳. Review [key crates](../key_crates.md) for topic ideas.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md][rust-howto-contributing] for more details.
