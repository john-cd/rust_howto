[`{{i:Crux}}`][Crux]â®³ is an experimental approach to building {{i:cross-platform}} applications.

 It splits the application into two distinct parts, a Core built in Rust, which drives as much of the business logic as possible, and a Shell, built in the platform native language (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript), which provides all interfaces with the external world, including the human user, and acts as a platform on which the core runs.

 The architecture is {{i:event-driven}}, based on {{i:event sourcing}}. The Core holds the majority of state, which is updated in response to events happening in the Shell. The interface between the Core and the Shell is {{i:message-based}}.

The {{i:user interface}} layer is built natively, with modern declarative UI frameworks such as Swift UI, Jetpack Compose and React/Vue or a {{i:WASM}} based framework on the web.
