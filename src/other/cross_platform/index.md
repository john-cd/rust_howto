[`Crux`][c-crux]{{hi:Crux}}â®³ is an experimental approach to building cross-platform{{hi:cross-platform}} applications.

 It splits the application into two distinct parts, a Core built in Rust, which drives as much of the business logic as possible, and a Shell, built in the platform native language (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript), which provides all interfaces with the external world, including the human user, and acts as a platform on which the core runs.

 The architecture is event-driven{{hi:event-driven}}, based on event sourcing{{hi:event sourcing}}. The Core holds the majority of state, which is updated in response to events happening in the Shell. The interface between the Core and the Shell is message-based{{hi:message-based}}.

The user interface{{hi:user interface}} layer is built natively, with modern declarative UI frameworks such as Swift UI, Jetpack Compose and React/Vue or a WASM{{hi:WASM}} based framework on the web.
