## Wgpu

A cross-platform, safe, pure-Rust graphics API: [github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)

It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm. The API is based on theÂ [WebGPU standard](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/). It serves as the core of the WebGPU integration in Firefox and Deno.
