# Shared-State Concurrency

Channels are similar to single ownership, because once you transfer a value down a channel, you should no longer use that value. Shared memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: multiple threads can access the same memory location at the same time.

The Rust standard library provides smart pointer types, such as `Mutex<T>` and `Arc<T>`, that are safe to use in concurrent contexts.

## Mutex

Allow access to data from one thread at a time.

## Parking Lot

[![parking-lot][parking-lot-badge]][parking-lot]  [(crates.io)][parking-lot-crate]

[Parking Lot][parking-lot]â®³ provides implementations of `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Condvar` and `Once` that are smaller, faster and more flexible than those in the Rust standard library. It also provides a `ReentrantMutex` type.

`std::sync::Mutex` works fine, but `Parking Lot` is faster.
