## Parallelism

[![cat-concurrency][cat-concurrency-badge]][cat-concurrency]

- True simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple cores or processors.
- Mechanism: uses operating system threads{{hi:Operating system threads}}.
- Important for CPU-heavy computations{{hi:CPU-heavy computations}}.
- Often requires explicit management of threads and thread pools{{hi:Thread pools}}.
- Requires careful synchronization to prevent data races (using mechanisms like Mutexes or atomics).

- Overhead due to thread creation and switching.

Key constructs in Rust:

- Threads{{hi:Threads}} are independent units of execution that can be spawned using e.g. `std::thread::spawn`{{hi:`std::thread::spawn`}}.
- Mutexes e.g. `std::sync::Mutex`{{hi:`std::sync::Mutex`}} protect shared data from race conditions.
- Channels{{hi:Channels}} e.g. `std::sync::mpsc`{{hi:`std::sync::mpsc`}} allow threads to communicate and exchange data.

Here are the topics weâ€™ll cover:

- [Multithreading](multithreading.md)
- [Message passing](message_passing.md)
- [Shared-state concurrency](shared_state/index.md)
- [Concurrent data structures](shared_state/concurrent_data_structures.md)
