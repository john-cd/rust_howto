# Concurrency

[![cat-concurrency][cat-concurrency-badge]][cat-concurrency]{{hi:Concurrency}}

This section covers concurrent programming, and specifically parallel programming{{hi:Parallel programming}}.

Parallelism implies:

- True simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple cores or processors.
- Mechanism: uses operating system threads{{hi:Operating system threads}}.
- Important for CPU-heavy computations{{hi:CPU-heavy computations}}.
- Often requires explicit management of threads and thread pools{{hi:Thread pools}}.
- Requires careful synchronization to prevent data races (using mechanisms like mutexes or atomics).
- Overhead due to thread creation and switching.

Key constructs in Rust:

- Threads{{hi:Threads}} are independent units of execution that can be spawned using e.g. `std::thread::spawn`{{hi:std::thread::spawn}}.
- Mutexes e.g. `std::sync::Mutex`{{hi:std::sync::Mutex}} protect shared data from race conditions.
- Channels{{hi:Channels}} e.g. `std::sync::mpsc`{{hi:std::sync::mpsc}} allow threads to communicate and exchange data.
