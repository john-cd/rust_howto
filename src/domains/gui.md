# GUI

[Are we GUI yet?][are-we-gui-yet?]⮳

GTK and Tauri are probably the only options which can be described as production-ready without caveats.
The Rust native options are usable for simple projects but are all still quite incomplete.

See the relevant section in [blessed.rs][blessed-rs]⮳

## Tauri

[Tauri][tauri-website]⮳ is an app construction toolkit that lets you build software for all major desktop operating systems using web technologies. It is similar to `Electron`.

## egui

[egui][egui]⮳ is an easy-to-use immediate mode GUI that runs on both web and native. `egui` aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

## Other GUI frameworks

Slint

[iced-rs][iced-rs-github]⮳: a cross-platform GUI library for Rust, inspired by Elm.

[druid][druid-github]⮳: a data-first Rust-native UI design toolkit (experimental).
