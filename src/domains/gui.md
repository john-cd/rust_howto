# GUI

[Are we GUI yet?]( https://www.areweguiyet.com/ )

GTK and Tauri are probably the only options which can be described as production-ready without caveats.
The Rust native options are usable for simple projects but are all still quite incomplete.

See the relevant section in [blessed.rs]( https://blessed.rs/crates )

## Tauri

[Tauri]( https://tauri.app/ ) is an app construction toolkit that lets you build software for all major desktop operating systems using web technologies. It is equivalent to Electron.

## egui

[egui]( https://crates.io/crates/egui ) is an easy-to-use immediate mode GUI that runs on both web and native. egui aims to be the best choice when you want a simple way to create a GUI, or you want to add a GUI to a game engine.

## Other GUI frameworks

[iced-rs]( https://github.com/iced-rs ): a cross-platform GUI library for Rust, inspired by Elm.

[druid]( https://github.com/linebender/druid ): a data-first Rust-native UI design toolkit (experimental).
