## Spawn a short-lived thread

[![crossbeam-badge]][crossbeam] [![cat-concurrency-badge]][cat-concurrency]

The example uses the [crossbeam] crate, which provides data structures and functions
for concurrent and parallel programming. [`Scope::spawn`] spawns a new scoped thread that is guaranteed
to terminate before returning from the closure that passed into [`crossbeam::scope`] function, meaning that
you can reference data from the calling function.

This example splits the array in half and performs the work in separate threads.

```rust,editable
{#include ../../../deps/examples/crossbeam-spawn.rs}
