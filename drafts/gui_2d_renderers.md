# 2D Renderers

## femtovg

"OpenGL based. Offers a simple API. Probably the easiest to get started with."

## skia-safe

"Bindings to the Skia C++ library. The most complete option with excellent performance. However, it can be difficult to get it to compile."

## vello

"WGPU based and uses cutting edge techniques to render vector paths using the GPU. Still somewhat immature and hasn't yet put out a stable release."

## vger

"A simpler WGPU based option which is less innovative but currently more stable than vello."

## webrender

"OpenGL based. Mature with production usage in Firefox but documentation and OSS maintenance are lacking."
