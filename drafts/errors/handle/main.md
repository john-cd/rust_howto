## Handle errors correctly in main

[![error-chain-badge]][error-chain] [![cat-rust-patterns-badge]][cat-rust-patterns]

Handles error that occur when trying to open a file that does not
exist. It is achieved by using [error-chain], a library that takes
care of a lot of boilerplate code needed in order to [handle errors in Rust].

`Io(std::io::Error)` inside [`foreign_links`] allows automatic
conversion from [`std::io::Error`] into [`error_chain!`] defined type
implementing the [`Error`] trait.

The below recipe will tell how long the system has been running by
opening the Unix file `/proc/uptime` and parse the content to get the
first number. Returns uptime unless there is an error.

Other recipes in this book will hide the [error-chain] boilerplate, and can be
seen by expanding the code with the â¤¢ button.
